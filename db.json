      "description": "in line with Barbados establishing itself as the epicurean capital of the Caribbean, Strong Foods embraces the idea of taking what was once considered an inexpensive but nutritious food for enslaved Africans on the island and leveraging it to celebrate the diversity of Barbadian heritage and the richness of its cuisine. This led to the culinary creation of the Breadfruit Bowl and the Yelluh Meat Brand! Yelluh Meat is a street-food ambrosia experience inspired by traditional roasted breadfruit.\n\nToday, the outdoor counter service concept, harnesses the traditional community spirit and activity of roasting breadfruit for a harmonious collective of families, friends and strangers alike to experience heritage in a new light. Yelluh Meat combines the beloved roasted provision with comfort food fillings, using only the highest quality ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. This continues to successfully bring patrons closer to the Bajan cultural experience. The company continues to be driven by its mission to give individuals a taste of authentic Bajan culture through the richness of traditional cuisine.",
